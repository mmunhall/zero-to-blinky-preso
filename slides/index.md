# Zero to Blinky: Up and Running with Raspberry Pi and Arduino

note:
- Poll - Pi and Arduino Usage
- I will show you, in painful detail: Set up units from scratch
    - Getting up and running with Pi and Arduino is not difficult
    - Tons of great information, but scattered across the internet
    - For the Pi: Will show MY preferred way of getting up and running
    - For Arduino: There isn't much to it.
