##  Pi Setup - Overview

1. Gather Pi, peripherals and components
2. Install and configure the OS,
3. Get the Pi on the local network,
4. Configure the Pi for use over SSH
5. Install Node.js and required modules
6. Test the GPIO

note:
- This is how *I* set up a Pi from scratch.
- This is also a pretty typical setup.
- Prereq: Some Linux chops *may* be necessary. Definitely helpful.
